- **Delegated Proof-Of-Stake (DPoS):** Delegate-Based Voting System.
- **UTXO Model:** Unspent Transaction Output System For Secure Transactions.
- **Mempool:** Transaction Pool For Pending Transactions.
- **Genesis Block:** Initial Block Creation.

### Smart Contracts 📜
- **Script Engine:** Basic Scripting Language For Programmable Money.
- **OpCodes Support:** Includes Common Operations Like OP_DUP, OP_HASH160, OP_CHECKSIG, Etc.
- **Contract Manager:** Handles Deployment And Execution Of Smart Contracts.

### Networking 🌐
- **Peer-To-Peer Network:** Advanced P2P With Peer Discovery And Gossip Protocol.
- **WebSocket Support:** Real-Time Communication Between Nodes.
- **Peer Quality Assessment:** Scoring System For Reliable Network Connections.

### Wallet And Transactions 💰
- **Wallet Creation:** Generate New Wallets With Public/Private Key Pairs.
- **Balance Management:** Check Wallet Balances.
- **Transaction Handling:** Send And Receive Transactions.
- **Cryptographic Security:** ECDSA Signatures For Transaction Verification.

### API And Monitoring 📊
- **Flask API:** RESTful API For Wallet, Transaction, And Node Operations.
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevents Abuse With Request Limits.
- **Swagger Documentation:** Interactive API Docs.
- **Prometheus Metrics:** Monitoring And Alerting Support.
- **JWT Authentication:** Secure API Access.

### Additional Features 🔧
- **Logging:** Comprehensive Logging System.
- **Configuration Management:** YAML-Based Config Files.
- **Data Storage:** Persistent Storage For Blockchain Data.
- **Consensus Engine:** Switchable Consensus Algorithms.

## Installation

1. **Clone The Repository:** 📥
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd i8o8iCoin
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:** 📦
   ```
   pip install -r Requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure The Application:** ⚙️
   - Edit `BackEnd/Config.py` Or Use YAML Config Files In `Config/` Directory.

4. **Run The Application:** ▶️

## Usage

### Starting The Node 🚀
Run The Main Application To Start The Blockchain Node:
```
python BackEnd/App.py
```

The API Will Be Available At `http://localhost:5000` (Default Port).

### API Endpoints 🔗
- `POST /wallet/create` - Create A New Wallet.
- `GET /wallet/balance/<address>` - Get Wallet Balance.
- `POST /transaction/send` - Send A Transaction.
- `GET /blockchain/chain` - Get The Current Blockchain.
- `POST /node/register` - Register A New Peer Node.

For Full API Documentation, Visit `http://localhost:5000/apidocs` When The Server Is Running.

### Mining ⛏️
The Node Supports Mining Blocks Based On The Configured Consensus Algorithm. Mining Can Be Started Via API Calls Or Programmatically.
