## Usage

### Starting The Node üöÄ
Run The Main Application To Start The Blockchain Node:
```
python BackEnd/App.py
```

The API Will Be Available At `http://localhost:5000` (Default Port).

### API Endpoints üîó
- `POST /wallet/create` - Create A New Wallet.
- `GET /wallet/balance/<address>` - Get Wallet Balance.
- `POST /transaction/send` - Send A Transaction.
- `GET /blockchain/chain` - Get The Current Blockchain.
- `POST /node/register` - Register A New Peer Node.

For Full API Documentation, Visit `http://localhost:5000/apidocs` When The Server Is Running.

### Mining ‚õèÔ∏è
The Node Supports Mining Blocks Based On The Configured Consensus Algorithm. Mining Can Be Started Via API Calls Or Programmatically.
